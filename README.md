# Description:

This repo contains an index.html and a style.css file that make up my website.

This website will serve as my professional protfolio. It provides an easy way for others to learn about me and my coding projects. I included about me, work examples, and contact sections, with the work examples setup to one day link to the proposed projects (once I complete them). The page has a nav bar that will scroll to the desired section and also scales to fit screens of any size. All links open in a new tab and the page colors were chosen to give high level of contrast without being distracting to the user.
